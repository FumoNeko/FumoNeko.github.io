<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
    <p>This is a temporary placeholder page for a project called "Market 76"</p>
<p>Hopefully it isn't too buggy and it works. This project is only intended as a small scale test, and is welcome to be picked up to be turned into something bigger.</p>
